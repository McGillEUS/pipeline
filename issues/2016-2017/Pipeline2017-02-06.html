      <h4> If you represent an EUS Club, Committee, Team, or other group, please consider adding your group to the EUS system of websites! Adding your group to the EUS website gives people a more complete picture of what the EUS has to offer, and is mutually beneficial for all groups - by looking for one group, all are seen in the process.</h4>

      <span class="heading-top">Goal #1</span>
      <h6>Our first goal is to have all EUS groups listed with a logo and a description at mcgilleus.ca/groups. For those that are already listed, feel free to send updates at any time to webmaster@mcgilleus.ca. If your group is not listed, then please send us an email with:</h6>

      <h6>
        <ul>
          <li>your group logo</li>
          <li>a description of your group (see mcgilleus.ca/groups for examples)</li>
          <li>any links you would like to point to (Facebook, LinkedIn, your group website, etc)</li>
          <li>whether your group is a Club, Committee, Competition, Design Team, Event, or some combination of the above</li>
        </ul>
      </h6>
    </section>

    <section class="fancy-heading left">
      <span class="heading-top">Goal #2</span>
      <h6>Our second goal is for each interested group to have its own webpage. Groups fall into three categories:</h6>
      <h6>
        <ol>
          <li>don't want a website (e.g. would prefer just to have a Facebook page)</li>
          <li>already have or currently creating a website, designed by members within the group</li>
          <li>would like to have a website, but don't have members with the time or skills to design one</li>
        </ol>
      </h6>
      <br>
      <h4>Category 1</h4>
      <h6>If you can fit all of the information you need into your group description at mcgilleus.ca/groups and a Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/LinkedIn/MySpace page, that's great! Be sure to include those links when you send us your description.</h6>
      <br>
      <h4>Category 2</h4>
      <h6>We would like to have all EUS group websites accessible via the mcgilleus.ca website. That generally means that there will be a link at the bottom of your group description that points to your group's website.</h6>
      <h6>In an effort to make the world of EUS websites more united, we would also like if there was link somewhere on your site that pointed to mcgilleus.ca - what that entails can be discussed on a case-by-case basis after you email us.</h6>
      <h6>If you would like your website to be hosted on the EUS servers (i.e. the domain would be [your-group-name].mcgilleus.ca), please contact the EUS IT Director, Lou Bernardi, at it.director@mcgilleus.ca.</h6>
      <br>
      <h4>Category 3</h4>
      <h6>We are considering starting a new Web Design Committee, where members could practice creating websites by designing and maintaining the websites of EUS groups.</h6>
      <h6>The process would work similar to that of Plumbers' Student Design - EUS groups could submit a request for a complete website or assistance on a specific aspect of their site, and after approval those requests would be fulfilled by other students free of charge. The site would then be hosted on the EUS servers with the domain [your-group-name].mcgilleus.ca.</h6>
      <h6>Before starting the committee, we would like to gauge interest, so <strong>please let us know if you would use this service!</strong></h6>
